## fasteR

This repository will contain slides and examples for my tutorial at useR Brisbane, on ways of speeding up R code

The tutorial will run from 1:30-5pm on Tuesday 10 July, in room P10


Along with a recent version of R, please install the following packages:

dplyr
dbplyr
Matrix 
MonetDBlite
profvis


I'll also show an example using bigQF, which is available as

devtools::install_github("tslumley/bigQF")

but you'll need a C compiler to install the package
